[338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)


__Question__

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.


__SOLUTION COMPLEXITY__

- Time complexity is Liner O(n): Because there is only one **for loop** in the code
- Space complexity is O(n): Becasue we need to store the solution to return them as vector.
