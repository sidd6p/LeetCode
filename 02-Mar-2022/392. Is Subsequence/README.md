[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)


__Question__

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).



  __Time Complexity__: O(n) where n is the size of _string t_ because there is only one for _for loop_.
 
 
 __Space Complexity__: O(1) because we need to store value of _i (index of s)_
